# Ontario Poll Concordance
 
A set of SQL Scripts for creating a concordance database that provides estimated values for Census data at the level of the Ontario provincial poll. In a new database, execute the DDL script, then the ETL script, after replacing file paths with the location of those files on your own computer. Use the stored procedure provided as a reference for developing your own queries.

CSVs compatible with these scripts, including geographic data in WKB format, are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1VsH__njLPUhGfrAW-6NmmsgTW8D8XxnK). Census Profile data is available from Statistics Canada [here](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/download-telecharger/comp/page_dl-tc.cfm?Lang=E).
